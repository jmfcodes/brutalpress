# BrutalPress

A brutalist WordPress theme. [View demo site on Neocities.](https://brutalpress.neocities.org/)

Mostly functional. Use at your own risk.

## TODO:

- remove clickability from page titles: they're redundant.
- add pagination for blog posts?
- what to do with comments? (besides reject the comments feature on moral grounds) display, permalink-only-view?

## Credits

Inspired by [Brutstrap](https://emsenn.neocities.org/brutstrap/).

Created with help from [Tania  Rascia's WP theme tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/).
