# BrutalPress

A brutalist WordPress theme.

Mostly functional. Use at your own risk.

## TODO:

- remove clickability from page titles: they're redundant.
- what to do with comments? (besides reject the comments feature on moral grounds) display, permalink-only-view?

## TODO:

- fix copyright statement in footer
- remove date and author from page view, or make it a user option
- make blog titles clickable OR add permalink to each post in blog view
- what to do with comments? (besides reject the comments feature on moral grounds) display, permalink-only-view?
